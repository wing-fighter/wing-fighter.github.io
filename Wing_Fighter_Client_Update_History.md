* Fighter skills: summon an energy gathering device in front of the fighter every 16 seconds for 4 seconds. Damage increased when your barrage passes through the Shaped Device.

* Description: Destroyer, bringing chaos and destruction to the world again and again. But he was not the personification of malice, and his arrival often heralded new beginnings. He is a light in the darkness, a new life after destruction!


**New Titan Boss:**

* Introduction: In the depths of the ocean, Kraken of the North is sleeping. This dangerous and powerful opponent is the sea octopus monster, with her terrible tentacles prey on innocent people. She is not only cunning, but also full of destructive power, once the rage, everything on the sea will be destroyed in a moment. So be sure to protect yourself - be careful of her tentacles!


* Please note: The Titans Challenge season starts at 000 on 24 October. This season the damage done to Titan Kraken will increase by 100% after wearing the Destroyer 5 Piece Suit.
