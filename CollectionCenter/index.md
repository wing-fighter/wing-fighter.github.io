## Rules

  1. Rich mineral resources have been found in the Asteroid Belt. Each player can build a collection center and have its own mining area here.<br/>
  2. In the mining area, one resource chest can be automatically refreshed per hour, up to a maximum of 8. Player can refresh resource chests manually. <br/>
  3. The higher the level of the collection center, the higher the max level of the refreshed resource chests.<br/>
  4. Player need to send fighters to escort resource chests back to the collection center. The higher the total power of the fighters sent, the less time it will take.<br/>
  5. Player can loot other players' resource chests. A player can only be looted once by the same opponent at a time.<br/>
  6. When two players scramble for the same resource chest, the player with the higher power will win. When both sides have the same power, the defending side will win.<br/>
  7. When the number of resource chests in the player's mining area is less than 3, the resource chests cannot be looted.<br/>
  8. Each transport or looting consumes 1 point of fuel. Replacing fighters during transport does not consume additional fuel.<br/>
  9. 1 point of fuel can be automatically restored every 90 minutes. Player can store up to 16 points of fuel.
