## Rules

  

**Base Rules**


  1. Legion members need to reach 5 or more, and the legion activity needs to reach 2500 or more to register for Planet Wars.<br/>
  2. Legion leaders and vice leaders can select auto registration in the legion settings. If the registration conditions are met, the legion will automatically be registered when the registration phase begins.<br/>
  3. Every 6 legions will be divided into a group to compete, with rankings determined by the total amount of rare earth collected by all members of the legion.<br/>
  4. All legions start at Bronze tier. After the event, the legion tier for the next competition will be determined according to the legion ranking. Competing in higher tiers can get richer rewards.<br/>
  5. Player cannot participate in Planet Wars within 24 hours after leaving the legion.<br/>
  6. After the event, the amount of rare earth collected by the legions and players will be reset to 0.<br/>
  7. During the event, the rare earth collected by members who leave the legion will not be deducted from the legion rare earths, but their personal rare earth will be reset to 0.<br/>


**Combat Rules**


  1. The battles in Planet Wars are automatically simulated. Both sides start attacking at the same time, with the side having higher power hitting the opponent first.<br/>
  2. The attack attributes of both sides, including attack, attack rate, crit rate, crit damage, and defense break, will be calculated based on the development of their respective equipment and fighters. <br/>
  3. The defense attributes of both sides, including HP, dodge rate, damage reduction, and defense, will be calculated based on the development of their respective equipment and fighters.<br/>
  4. Fighters with special skills (such as Phantom, Syren, and Crow) will not release skills in battle, but will deal damage to the opponent in the form of bullets.<br/>
  5. Ultimate and Revival effects do not take effect in battle.<br/>
  6. If the battle lasts longer than 30 seconds, the side with a higher percentage of remaining HP wins.<br/>
  7. Launching an attack will consume 1 attack attempt. The attack attempt will recover over time.<br/>


**Occupation Rules**


  1. Unoccupied planets can be directly occupied. Defeating the occupiers can gain the right to occupy the planet. After defeating the opponent, the player has 1 minute to decide whether to occupy the planet. If no choice is made for more than 1 minute, the player will lose the right to occupy.<br/>
  2. Lv.1 to Lv.3 planets have a 1-hour protection period after occupation, during which time they cannot be attacked by other players. Lv.4 and Lv.5 planets have no protection period after occupation.<br/>
  3. Each player can only occupy at most 1 planet at the same time.<br/>
  4. Each planet can be occupied for up to 8 hours each time. The planet will be in an unoccupied state after the occupation time reaches 8 hours.<br/>
  5. The higher the planet level, the higher the rare earth output. The higher the legion tier, the higher the planet's output.<br/>
  6. Occupying a planet will consume 1 occupation attempt. The occupation attempt will recover over time. And diamonds can be used to purchase occupation attempts.<br/>
